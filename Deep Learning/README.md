# Notebook Description 

Remarkable advancement has been made in image recognition, primarily due to the availability of large-scale annotated datasets to train deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This report aims to evaluate the use of different convolution neural network architectures to accurately detect childhood pneumonia on chest x-rays images. The model uses different CNN models including ResNet, Inception, VGG to evalaute the best model accuracy in predicting pneumonia.
