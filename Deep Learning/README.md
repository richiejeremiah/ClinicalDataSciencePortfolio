# Notebook Description 

Remarkable advancement has been made in image recognition, primarily due to the availability of large-scale annotated datasets to train deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The python notebook above aims to evaluate the use of a  convolution neural network architecture to accurately detect childhood pneumonia on chest x-rays images.
