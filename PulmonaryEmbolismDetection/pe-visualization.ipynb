The clots typically originates from the deep venous system of the lower extremities as shown in the *image below*. After traveling to the lung, large thrombi can lodge at the bifurcation of the main pulmonary artery or the lobar branches and cause hemodynamic compromise. The condition usually presents with an abrupt onset of sharp chest pain, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. However symptoms may vary from sudden catastrophic hemodynamic collapse to gradually progressive dyspnea. \n\n**Diagnosis**\nThere are various tools for diagnosing PE. \nIn this project we will focus on CT angiography commonly used in clinical practice. Intravenous contrast is administered through the patient's veins just prior to obtaining the CT, and the CT scan is timed to obtain images when the contrast is primarily in the pulmonary blood vessels. Note: this is where quality issues can occur. Sometimes the timing of the scan is off, resulting in a suboptimal scan. This can result in non-diagnostic or equivocal studies. In addition, if the patient is moving a lot or has metal in their body, this can cause artifacts which may obscure a clot.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"(Image Source: Medscape)\n![](https://img.medscapestatic.com/pi/meds/ckb/22/38722tn.jpg)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Pulmonary Embolism CT Scan**\n\nIn the image below, notice the areas marked in the red color in the **Pulmonary Trunk**.
