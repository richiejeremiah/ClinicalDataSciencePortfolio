# Overview
<p align="justify">
Pulmonary embolism (PE) is caused by an artery blockage in the lung. It is time consuming to confirm a PE and prone to overdiagnosis. Currently, CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA), is the most common type of medical imaging to evaluate patients with suspected PE. These CT scans consist of hundreds of images that require detailed review to identify clots within the pulmonary arteries. As the use of imaging continues to grow, constraints of radiologists’ time may contribute to delayed diagnosis. Machine learning could help to accurately identify PE cases, making management and treatment more effective for patients.

The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA®) is an international society of radiologists, medical physicists, and other medical professionals with more than 53,400 members worldwide. RSNA hosts the world’s premier radiology forum and publishes two top peer-reviewed journals: Radiology, the highest-impact scientific journal in the field, and RadioGraphics, the only journal dedicated to continuing education in radiology. The Society of Thoracic Radiology (STR) was founded in 1982. The STR is dedicated to advancing cardiothoracic imaging in clinical application, education, and research in radiology and allied disciplines. Continuing professional development opportunities provided by the STR include educational and scientific meetings, mentorship programs, grant support and award opportunities, our society journal, Journal of Thoracic Imaging, and global collaboration activities.
