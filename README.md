# ClinicalDataSciencePortfolio
A collection of selected clinical data science and artificial intelligence (AI) projects in medicine to demonstrate my skill sets, knowledge, and interests

# Contents
* Malaria Data Analysis: Exploring and analysing medical records from a pediatric clinical dataset collected from Kakamega county in Kenya using Pandas, Numpy and Scipy libraries. 
Statistical analysis and meaningful data visualization techniques are perfomed on the clinical data.  
* Malaria Prediction: Using the above data a decision tree model is build to predict malaria in children based on features that mainly include pediatric sympotms, infant age and sex
* Pneumonia Detection: Prediction of pediatric pneumonia on chest x-rays using a Convolutional Neural Network model
* Pulmonary Embolism Detection: Visualising and 3D ploting of DICOM CTAP scans with pulmonaly embolism and developing a deep learning model to detect the condition
