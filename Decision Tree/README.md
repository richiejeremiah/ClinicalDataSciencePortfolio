# Notebook Description


In this Notebook we try to develop a decision tree model that can be able to predict pediatric Malaria based on their signs and symptoms. Malaria is common disease in Kenya that still affects many children in the country. A Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) is commonly used to clinically diagnosed Malaria. The model therefore tries to predict where a child has a positive or negative RDT based on features in the dataset.
